# Dog-Breed-Classifier

# Overview
The purpose of the project is to create a dog breed classifier that can identify a dog's breed given a picture of a dog. It can also tell if there is a human in the picture instead of dogs and also can tell what breed of dog will the human be which is really a fun part.

# Files:
1. dog-app.ipynb : is the python 3 file that can be run to classify dog images
2. test: the folder has the test images for this project.
3. Readme

# Packages
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. opencv
5. glob
6. sklearn
7. keras
8. random
9. PIL

# Pretrained CNN models
1. VGG-16
2. Xception

# Conclusion
The performance of the pre-trained model built far exceeded the hand made CNN model. The accuracy of the Xception model (reached 85% while my CNN was about 7%.
